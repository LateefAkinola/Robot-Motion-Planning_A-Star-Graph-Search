def A_star_search(nodes, edges):

    '''
    Function to find and print an optimal path using the A* algorithm
    If path is found, it saves as "path.csv" 

    input:
    nodes : a list of nodes; each of the form [ID,x,y,heuristic-cost-to-go]
    edges : a list of edges; each of the form [ID1,ID2,cost] 

    Returns:
    path : returns a list of the form [ID1,ID2,...] if part is found; else: 
           returns 1
